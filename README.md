# ConsoleApp1 using names.csv, a 46K file containing over five-thousand first names, implement the following requirements:
 
1. Parse the file, load the names list in memory
2. Sort the list of names in alphabetical order
3. Calculate the score of each name.
   To do this, work out the alphabetical value of every name and multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list.
   For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 772th name in the list
   So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714
4. Determine the total score by calculating the sum of all the name scores in the list
